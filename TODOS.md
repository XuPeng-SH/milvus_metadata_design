# Snapshot Implementation TODOs

## Phase I
- [ ] Migrate code from demo repo to Milvus

- [ ] Implement metastore service
    - [ ] Delicated thread worker
    - [ ] Delicated queue

- [ ] Implement metastore operation APIs
    - [ ] MySQL
    - [ ] SQLite

- [ ] Meta data and disk data cleanup
    - [ ] Impelement steps
        1. Soft delete all stale resources meta data
        2. Hard delete all stale resources in disk
        3. Hard delete all stale resources meta data
    - [ ] Implement background executor and queue
    - [ ] Error handling - *Open*
        1. Problem with meta data soft deletion
        2. Problem with disk data hard deletion
        3. Problem with meta data hard deletion

- [ ] Startup init procesure
    - [ ] Start meta data service and gc service
    - [ ] Load all collection snapshots
    - [ ] Cleanup all stale resources
        1. Collect all soft delete resources from meta store
        2. Check whether specfied disk resource has been hard deleted
            - If no, do disk cleanup and hard delete meta. Any fails, fails startup
            - If yes, continue

- [ ] Snapshot code optimization
    - [ ] Add num field for resoures to make the number increase without stop point(1,2,3,4â€¦)
    - [ ] Add more fields like version, params etc.
    - [ ] More helper function and APIs
    - [ ] Thread safe and non-blocking
    - [ ] Memory usage optimization
    - [ ] Support rollback

- [ ] Existed operations to use new snapshot apis
    - [ ] Partition related
    - [ ] Search
    - [ ] Flush
    - [ ] Build
    - [ ] Merge
    - [ ] Compact
    - [ ] Create collection | partition
    - [ ] Drop collection | partition

- [ ] Structure search related code migration to snapshot

- [ ] Debug helper function and tools for snapshot
    - [ ] Track all modification operation
    - [ ] Printable steps
